### Simple Exponential Smoothing :-
Simple exponential smoothing method is suitable for the data that do not have any clear trend or seasonality. For eg. Annual oil production in Saudi Arabia
```{r}
oildata <- window(oil, start = 1996)
autoplot(oildata) +
  xlab("Year") + ylab("Oil(million of tonnes)")
```

The above timeplot do not shows any clear trending behaviour or seasonality.
